    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>
        The Voice is an open, publicly accessible voice dataset, powered by volunteers from across the globe.
        Developers looking to build voice-enabled applications can use this dataset to train machine learning. <br><models class="br"></models>
        Currently, most voice datasets are controlled by corporations, limiting innovation. These datasets often lack
        representation of non-English speakers, people of color, individuals with disabilities, women, and LGBTOIA+ communities.
        <br>
        As a result, voice technology either doesn't support many languages or works inconsistently across different groups. Our goal
        is to change this by encouraging people worldwide to contribute their voices and help improve inclusivity in voice technology.

                 A language is a system of communication used by humans,
                consisting of sounds, symbols, words, and rules
                that enable people to express thoughts, ideas,
                emotions, and information. It can be spoken, written,
                or signed, and follows specific grammar and syntax to ensure
                that the message is understood by others within the same linguistic community.
